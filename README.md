Hi ðŸ‘‹ ,   
 Iâ€™m @kellyskogheim. I'm an data scientist/actuary currently working in insurance. I'm interested in following my string and learning from whom/whereever I can. 
 I also want to leverage git for tracking edits made to my writing work - as I think it'd be cool to see the editting process that way :)
 Enjoy!  
Kelly
